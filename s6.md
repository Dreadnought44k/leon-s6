# s6

init system made purely with s6 and written in posix shell and execline

UPDATE: /bin/s6-shutdown was rewritten in execline and is working, also renamed to s6-stage3

UPDATE: /bin/s6-stage{1,2} are avaliable in another repo as broken implementations that still need lots of work

UPDATE: /bin/s6-stage{1,2,3} are fully funcional 

---

## How it works

the arg init=/sbin/s6-stage1 is passed on the commandline, it will start a unmodified init image from skarnet's s6-linux-init.

> To do a reboot: s6-svscanctl -6 /run/service

> To do a shutdown: s6-svscanctl -0 /run/service

#### do not call /bin/s6-stage3 in itself, it should be called by /service/.s6-svscan/finish with the proper arguments

### /bin/s6-stage1

unmodified script from skarnet's s6-linux-init

- does some skarnet voodoo magic
- it works

PS: Write my own script to learn how to do a safe stage1 like skarnet does.

### /bin/s6-stage2

stage2 execlineb script that is called by s6-stage1

- mount pseudo-filesystems, ignoring the devtmpfs (kernel) and the /run (stage1)
- does fsck
- remount root as read-write
- mount other local filesystems
- activates swap
- merges env-stage2 into env
- check if keymap is set, if it is use on loadkeys
- check if hostname is set, if it is set hostname to it
- enables sysctl
- [PROBLABLY BROKEN] start random seed
- runs binfmt.sh
- moves all dir on /etc/s6/service.d to /run/service
- alerts s6-svscan on /run/service of new service
- if there user set, make it wait until the services are up
- activates network
- do udev triggers

### /bin/s6-stage3

stage3 execlineb script that is called by /service/.s6-svscan/finish when s6-svscan /service is called to die

- cd /
- brings /etc/s6/env-stage3 to env using s6-envdir
- syncs disks
- sends a kill signal for graceful kill
- waits a user-determined amount of time or doesn't wait if it's not set
- sends brutal kill signal for all processes except pid1 (itself)
- turns off swap
- umount local filesystems
- remount root as ro
- wait and sync
- calls either /sbin/reboot -f or /sbin/poweroff -f

--

### /etc/s6/service.d

dir that contains all long-lived supervised services, it is loaded in s6-stage2 and are expected to live until s6-stage3 kills them

--

### /etc/s6/run-image

dir that contains a logging service with uncaught-logs dir, it is implanted and ran by stage1 on /run , it is avalible since the begging and is the pid1 process

--

### /etc/s6/env-stage2

dir that allows users to define commands that will be used by s6-stage2 such as:


HOSTNAME ( your hostname )


KEYMAP ( keymap loaded with loadkeys )


SERVICE_TIMEWAIT ( time to wait until services are up )

--

### /etc/s6/env-stage3

dir that allows users to define commands that will be used by s6-stage3 such as:

TERM_GRACETIME ( time to sleep on gentle nuke before sending in the brutal one )
